## Limitations
Due to the Discord-API's Limitations, the Bot can only update a Dashboard (Message) every 5 Seconds if the Message is Older than one hour. Because of this, the Bot will only edit and update one Dashboard (Message) every 5 Seconds, if you set up 5 Servers, it will take 5 x 5 = 25 Seconds until one Rotation is done.
